# About the App
I wanted to teach myself a new frontend framework (Angular) and backend, which lead to the development of this app.

# Features
- Create recipes with a selection of around 140.000 ingredients
- Add the recipes to your mealplan
- Add those mealplan recipes to your shopping list
- The shopping list joins together ingredients that share the same unit and market and displays it as one tile
- If multiple ingredients share one tile, they can be marked as purchased in one go or individually by expanding the tile
- The shopping list displays ingredients that need to be bought today. Otherwise it lists them based on the prefered market
- You can invite family members
